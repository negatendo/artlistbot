# ArtListBot

 @ArtListsBot is a twitter bot that wants to add every artist to a list.

 @ArtListsBot is about the fallibility of those end of year artist lists. Content creating humans possess an undeniable bias when making these lists, and must rely on empericism, their friends, and perhaps a pre-holiday party drink to keep their energy up as they publish these canons, year after year. There are so many artists, and so much art, that creating an art list free of bias and heartbreak is an almost impossible task - so why not have the list creator HAVE NO HEART?

 We wondered if we created a robot to do it (as well as invented the lists) we would finally have an impartial list maker! We often mindlessly accept the algorithms that run our world, so why not this one? We wonder if people will question HOW the bot organizes the list, and what they will think when they learn it's completely random. We wonder if people will be more accepting of a bot making a list then a person?

 @ArtListsBot is an "active" list, changing over time, fluctuating, rather than a statement of "canon" (best of the year). It has the potential to outlive many of us! Maybe art lists are a job for a robot.
